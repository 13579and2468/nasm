              NASM, the Netwide Assembler.
                     Version 0.98.26.

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is
- a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very
flexible and mature assembler tool with support for many output
formats (thus netwide!!).

Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under LGPL.
This means its development is open to even wider society of
programmers wishing to improve their lovely assembler.

The NASM project is now situated at SourceForge.net, the most
famous Open Source development center on The Net.

Visit our development page at http://nasm.2y.net and our
SF project at http://sf.net/projects/nasm

The NASM documentation is in process of severe re-arrangement
(especially the License issues with sourcecode, the old
license can be found in doc/License), all files from previous
releases that didn't go thru the process yet are placed in doc/
subdirectory. Look there if you don't find a file you need here.


                                                   With best regards,
                                                           NASM crew.
