This is a modified version of NASM, modified and released by H. Peter
Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>; it is not the original form released by the
NASM authors.


For release 0.98.3.2:

* Merged in John S. Fine's changes from his 0.98-J4 prerelease; see
  http://www.csoft.net/cz/johnfine/

* Changed previous "spotless" Makefile target (appropriate for distribution)
  to "distclean", and added "cleaner" target which is same as "clean"
  except deletes files generated by Perl scripts; "spotless" is union.

* Removed BASIC programs from distribution.  Get a Perl interpreter
  instead (see below.)

* Calling this "pre-release 3.2" rather than "p3-hpa2" because of
  John's contributions.

* Actually link in the IEEE output format (zoutieee.c); fix a bunch of
  compiler warnings in that file.  Note I don't know what IEEE output
  is supposed to look like, so these changes were made "blind".


For release 0.98p3-hpa:

* Merged nasm098p3.zip with nasm-0.97.tar.gz to create a fully
  buildable version for Unix systems (Makefile.in updates, etc.)

* Changed insns.pl to create the instruction tables in nasm.h and
  names.c, so that a new instruction can be added by adding it *only*
  to insns.dat.

* Added the following new instructions: SYSENTER, SYSEXIT, FXSAVE,
  FXRSTOR, UD1, UD2 (the latter two are two opcodes that Intel
  guarantee will never be used; one of them is documented as UD2 in
  Intel documentation, the other one just as "Undefined Opcode" --
  calling it UD1 seemed to make sense.)

* A note on the BASIC programs included: forget them.  insns.bas is
  already out of date.  Get yourself a Perl interpreter for your
  platform of choice at:
