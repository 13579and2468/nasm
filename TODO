Things to do (incorporate with doc/Wishlist):

1. i18n via gettext
2. Convert shallow code model to deep code model. Tired of messing between
lots of unrelated files (especially .c/.h stuff).
3. Automated dependency generation for Makefile. Current looks awful and will break
if anything changes.
4. (as result of 2) Move output modules out*.c to output/ subdir. (?)
